L6234

The L6234 is a three phase motordriver from ST (st.com)
datasheet - http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00000046.pdf

It makes use of 3 half-bridges, enabling you to drive a bldc motor with your
favorite microcontroller and 3 pwm pins. (+ one additional output to enable the driver).

There is no feedback, so you rely on (like with a stepper motor) the load resistance being
lower than the motor torque (or you have to add some sort of feedback like an imu).
